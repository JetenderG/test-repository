            <p>Hello, the name is Jetender Ghatorora and you are in my bio. Not really have very active dude in the
                social world I spend my time in the web a lot, call me a caveman in a sort of modern way. Not to
                confues me as a anti- person or individual but not really talker. Most of my time takes place on my pc
                usually watching video and playing games. Not really aiming to be the best at anything but be good at
                something I love.</p>

            <p>Born in Canada living with a big family I can say for sure its difficult. Have two sister that are crazy
                in their own sense which I think most people have that experience with thier sibilings. H</p>
